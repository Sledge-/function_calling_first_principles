    "# Function Calling from First Principles\n",

    "These interaction allow the model to pursue goals with a greater scope of influence than just writing words.  There is a massive potential for goal seeking LLMs across a wide range of use cases, because of the open endedness of the problem solving approach.\n",

Each of its stands, strategically placed, tells a story of New York's ever-evolving landscape and appetite.\n",

As one moves further away, the second outlet is nestled 1.5 miles out in the charming West Village on Bleecker Street, pulling in a respectable $12,500 monthly. Heading 3 miles out, the third stand resides in the hip enclave of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on Bedford Avenue, where it enjoys a monthly revenue of $10,000, catering to the young and artsy crowd. At 4.2 miles from the city's core, the fourth stand in Astoria, Queens, on Ditmars Boulevard, manages to net $7,500 per month. Lastly, the fifth and furthest stand, 6 miles away in the scenic Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, on 3rd Avenue, garners $6,000 monthly, serving both locals and those eager for a waterfront view with their meal.\n",

If the column looks like it's categorical or nominal just ignore it.  We want to focus on numeric columns only. Also, describe which two columns you're forming function calls for as shown in the examples. When in doubt, just do the best you can.\\n\\nHere's a few example function call input/output pairs:\\n###\\nH:\\n| Name         | Metric1 | Metric2  | Value |\\n| Alice        | 12      | 35       | 45    |\\n| Bob          | 15      | 40       | 48    |\\n| Charlie      | 10      | 30       | 38    |\\n| David        | 14      | 37       | 44    |\\n| Eve          | 13      | 36       | 46    |\\n\\nA:\\nTrying Metric1 vs. Metric2\\n{\\n  \\\"function_call\\\": {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"run_linear_trend_model\\\", \\n    \\\"parameters\\\": {\\n      \\\"x\\\": [12, 15, 10, 14, 13],\\n      \\\"y\\\": [35, 40, 30, 37, 36]\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nH:\\n| Name         | Metric1 | Metric2  | Value |\\n| Alice        | 12      | 35       | 45    |\\n| Bob          | 15      | 40       | 48    |\\n| Charlie      | 10      | 30       | 38    |\\n| David        | 14      | 37       | 44    |\\n| Eve          | 13      | 36       | 46    |\\n\\nA:\\nTrying Metric1 vs. Value\\n{\\n  \\\"function_call\\\": {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"run_linear_trend_model\\\", \\n    \\\"parameters\\\": {\\n      \\\"x\\\": [12, 15, 10, 14, 13],\\n      \\\"y\\\": [45, 48, 38, 44, 46]\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n###\\n\\n\\nOk now here's the actual user's data:\\n###\\n\\n| Location                       | Distance from Center (miles)| Street               | Monthly Revenue ($)| Avg Price per Hot Dog ($)    | Monthly Customers Count | Top Selling Side Item | Employee Count | Customer Satisfaction (%) | Average Wait Time (minutes) |\\n| Broadway Avenue, Manhattan     | 0.5                         | Broadway Avenue      | 15,000             | 5                            | 3,000                   | Fries                 | 10             | 80                        | 15                          |\\n| West Village, Manhattan        | 1.5                         | Bleecker Street      | 12,500             | 5.5                          | 2,273                   | Soda                  | 8              | 85                        | 10                          |\\n| Williamsburg, Brooklyn         | 3                           | Bedford Avenue       | 10,000             | 6                            | 1,667                   | Cheese Sticks         | 7              | 88                        | 8                           |\\n| Astoria, Queens                | 4.2                         | Ditmars Boulevard    | 7,500              | 5.5                          | 1,364                   | Onion Rings           | 6              | 90                        | 6                           |\\n| Bay Ridge, Brooklyn            | 6                           | 3rd Avenue           | 6,000              | 5                            | 1,200                   | Pretzels              | 5              | 92                        | 5                           |\\n\\n\\n###\\n\\nNext, generate a function call that computes a linear regression, as defined in the FUNCTIONS, and prepare to recieve it's result. If the result shows a negative trend, it's fine to say that, but then immediately form a new function call using data from the user's table that hasn't been tried yet.  Keep going until the positive trend is found, and stop making function calls as soon as you see it.\\n\\nAssistant:\\n\\n\\n\\nAssistant:\\n Trying Monthly Revenue ($) vs. Avg Price per Hot Dog ($)\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"function_call\\\": {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"run_linear_trend_model\\\",\\n    \\\"parameters\\\": {\\n      \\\"x\\\": [15000, 12500, 10000, 7500, 6000], \\n      \\\"y\\\": [5, 5.5, 6, 5.5, 5]\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nResult:\\n{'slope': -7.504690431519706e-06, 'intercept': 5.4765478424015015, 'r_value': -0.06548583459265812, 'p_value': 0.9166804779545717, 'std_err': 6.602244031813863e-05}\\n\\nAssistant:\\n\\n\\nAssistant:\\n The trend appears to be slightly negative based on the r_value.

In my experience it takes about 3-5 iterations for the LLM to find the desired trend, although it will occasionally find one on the first try.\n",
