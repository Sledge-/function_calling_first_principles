In the bustling heart of New York City, near the iconic Times Square, a hot dog stand chain named "CityDogs" has made a name for itself. Founded in 2005, this humble hot dog stand started on the bustling streets of Manhattan and has since grown, weaving its savory aroma into the fabric of the city. Each of its stands, strategically placed, tells a story of New York's ever-evolving landscape and appetite.

The original stand, located just 0.5 miles from the center, sits on Broadway Avenue and has the highest revenue of $15,000 a month, thanks to the non-stop flow of tourists and city-dwellers alike. As one moves further away, the second outlet is nestled 1.5 miles out in the charming West Village on Bleecker Street, pulling in a respectable $12,500 monthly. Heading 3 miles out, the third stand resides in the hip enclave of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on Bedford Avenue, where it enjoys a monthly revenue of $10,000, catering to the young and artsy crowd. At 4.2 miles from the city's core, the fourth stand in Astoria, Queens, on Ditmars Boulevard, manages to net $7,500 per month. Lastly, the fifth and furthest stand, 6 miles away in the scenic Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, on 3rd Avenue, garners $6,000 monthly, serving both locals and those eager for a waterfront view with their meal.

As "CityDogs" continues to flourish, each location becomes a testament to New York's diverse population and their unifying love for a good hot dog. Whether it's the neon lights of Broadway or the quieter streets of Bay Ridge, these stands offer more than just a quick bite. They offer a slice of the city's soul, where distance and revenue intertwine in a dance as dynamic as New York itself.
